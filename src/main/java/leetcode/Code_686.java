     * Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it.
     * If no such solution, return -1.
     *
     * For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".
     *
     * Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring
     * of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").
     *
     * Note:
     * The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
     *
     *
     * 现有思路
     *
     * 1、将B构成环，会有重复的连续字符串出现 >=1
     *
     * 2、判断需要重复的次数
